# elif.rs Production Framework Development Plan

## Overview
This directory contains the complete iterative development plan for transforming elif.rs into a production-ready web framework with AI-first design principles.

## 🔄 **ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**
**New Philosophy**: Build a working framework incrementally, with each phase adding essential capabilities while maintaining a functional system throughout development.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **AI-Native Design**: Every feature designed with AI agent interaction in mind
2. **Production First**: Match or exceed Laravel/NestJS capabilities
3. **Developer Experience**: Rich tooling and intuitive APIs
4. **Performance**: Built for high-throughput, low-latency applications
5. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security by default

### AI Integration Strategy
- **MARKER-based Editing**: Safe zones for AI code modification
- **Rich Introspection**: APIs for AI understanding of project structure
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Framework provides semantic information
- **Error Recovery**: AI can understand and fix common framework issues

## Quick Start Guide

### For Continuing Development:
1. **Review Current Phase**: Check the appropriate phase directory for detailed specs
2. **Understand Dependencies**: Each phase builds on previous phases
3. **Follow Architecture**: Refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for design guidelines
4. **Track Progress**: Use phase-specific todo files and milestones

### For Implementation:
1. Start with Phase 1 - Architecture Foundation
2. Follow the detailed implementation specs in each phase directory
3. Run tests and benchmarks at each milestone
4. Update documentation as features are implemented

## Success Metrics

### Production Readiness Indicators:
- [ ] Can build complete e-commerce API in <2 hours
- [ ] Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Enterprise security audit passed
- [ ] Documentation completeness matching Laravel
- [ ] Active ecosystem with 3rd party packages
- [ ] AI agents can build complex applications autonomously

### Performance Targets:
- Response time: <50ms for simple queries
- Throughput: 50,000+ requests/second
- Memory usage: <100MB for basic application
- Cold start: <500ms for serverless deployment

## Current Status (2025-08-15)
- **Framework Stage**: Phase 3 Security & Architecture - Essential Middleware & Framework Consistency
- **Completed Phases**: 
  - ✅ **Phase 1**: Architecture Foundation (DI container, modules, config, lifecycle) - 33 tests
  - ✅ **Phase 2**: Web Foundation Complete - 61 tests
    - ✅ HTTP Server Core (Axum integration, DI container)
    - ✅ Routing System (dynamic params, groups, middleware)
    - ✅ Request/Response Abstractions (JSON, validation)
    - ✅ Basic Middleware Pipeline (logging, timing)
    - ✅ Controller System & Database Integration (service-oriented)
    - ✅ Error Handling & JSON API Response Format
  - ✅ **Phase 2.1**: ORM Foundation (Model trait, Query builder) - 36 tests
  - ✅ **Phase 3**: Security & Architecture Foundation - 25 tests
    - ✅ **Phase 3.1**: CORS Middleware Implementation (Issue #29) 
    - ✅ **Phase 3.2**: CSRF Protection Middleware (Issue #30)
    - ✅ **Phase 3.7**: Framework Core Architecture - Remove Axum Re-exports (Issue #50)
    - ✅ **Phase 3.8**: Security Middleware Framework Integration (Issue #51)
- **Current Work**: 🚨 **CRITICAL** Phase 3.18 - HTTP Server Architecture Cleanup (Issue #57)
- **Completed**: Phase 3.9 - Server Architecture - Framework Middleware Integration (Issue #52)
- **Published Packages**: 
  - elif-core v0.2.0, elif-orm v0.2.0, elif-http v0.2.0, elif-security v0.2.1, elifrs v0.2.0
- **Test Coverage**: 155+ total tests passing across all crates
- **Architecture Status**: 🚨 **CRITICAL ISSUE** - Server implementations bypass framework abstractions, need consolidation
- **Next Phases**: Complete Phase 3 architectural consistency → Phase 4 Database Operations
- **Estimated Completion**: 10-15 months with architectural foundation complete
