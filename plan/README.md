# elif.rs Production Framework Development Plan

## Overview
This directory contains the complete iterative development plan for transforming elif.rs into a production-ready web framework with AI-first design principles.

## 🔄 **ITERATIVE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH**
**New Philosophy**: Build a working framework incrementally, with each phase adding essential capabilities while maintaining a functional system throughout development.

## Development Philosophy

### Core Principles
1. **AI-Native Design**: Every feature designed with AI agent interaction in mind
2. **Production First**: Match or exceed Laravel/NestJS capabilities
3. **Developer Experience**: Rich tooling and intuitive APIs
4. **Performance**: Built for high-throughput, low-latency applications
5. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security by default

### AI Integration Strategy
- **MARKER-based Editing**: Safe zones for AI code modification
- **Rich Introspection**: APIs for AI understanding of project structure
- **Context-Aware Generation**: Framework provides semantic information
- **Error Recovery**: AI can understand and fix common framework issues

## Quick Start Guide

### For Continuing Development:
1. **Review Current Phase**: Check the appropriate phase directory for detailed specs
2. **Understand Dependencies**: Each phase builds on previous phases
3. **Follow Architecture**: Refer to `ARCHITECTURE.md` for design guidelines
4. **Track Progress**: Use phase-specific todo files and milestones

### For Implementation:
1. Start with Phase 1 - Architecture Foundation
2. Follow the detailed implementation specs in each phase directory
3. Run tests and benchmarks at each milestone
4. Update documentation as features are implemented

## Success Metrics

### Production Readiness Indicators:
- [ ] Can build complete e-commerce API in <2 hours
- [ ] Handles 10,000+ concurrent connections
- [ ] Comprehensive test coverage (>90%)
- [ ] Enterprise security audit passed
- [ ] Documentation completeness matching Laravel
- [ ] Active ecosystem with 3rd party packages
- [ ] AI agents can build complex applications autonomously

### Performance Targets:
- Response time: <50ms for simple queries
- Throughput: 50,000+ requests/second
- Memory usage: <100MB for basic application
- Cold start: <500ms for serverless deployment

## Current Status (2025-08-15)
- **Framework Stage**: Phase 2 Controllers - Web Foundation 90% Complete
- **Completed Phases**: 
  - ✅ **Phase 1**: Architecture Foundation (DI container, modules, config, lifecycle)
  - ✅ **Phase 2.1**: ORM Foundation (Model trait, Query builder, 36 tests passing)
  - ✅ **Phase 2.1-2.4**: HTTP Server Core (Server, Routing, Request/Response, Middleware)
  - ✅ **Phase 2.5**: Controller System - Production-ready service-oriented controllers
- **Current Work**: Phase 3 - Essential Middleware & Validation
- **High Priority**: Phase 10 - Developer Experience & Laravel/NestJS Parity (DX critical)
- **Next Phases**: Phase 3 → Phase 10 (prioritized for developer adoption)
- **Estimated Completion**: 12-18 months with Phase 10 prioritization
