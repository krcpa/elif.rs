## Resource Allocation

### Team Composition by Phase:
- **Phase 1-2**: Core architecture developers (senior level)
- **Phase 3**: Security specialist + core developers
- **Phase 4**: DevX specialist + frontend developer + core developers
- **Phase 5-6**: Full-stack developers with ops experience

### Critical Path Items:
1. **Service Container** (Phase 1) - Everything depends on this
2. **Database Layer** (Phase 2) - Most applications need persistence
3. **Security System** (Phase 3) - Cannot ship without proper auth/authz
4. **CLI and Testing** (Phase 4) - Essential for developer adoption

### Risk Mitigation:
- **Technical Risks**: Weekly architecture reviews, prototype validation
- **Schedule Risks**: 20% buffer in each phase, parallel development where possible
- **Quality Risks**: Continuous testing, security audits, performance benchmarks

## Success Metrics by Phase

### Phase 1 Success:
- [ ] Service container resolves dependencies correctly

- [ ] Migrations can modify complex schemas
- [ ] Query performance meets benchmarks

### Phase 3 Success:
- [ ] Authentication works across multiple providers
- [ ] Authorization policies prevent unauthorized access
- [ ] Security middleware blocks common attacks
- [ ] Passes OWASP security checklist

### Phase 4 Success:
