# Introduction

elif.rs is a full-stack web framework focused on developer experience and pragmatic performance. It offers a Laravel-like workflow: expressive routing, powerful generators, first-class testing, and clear conventions across HTTP, database, security, and background jobs.

You can start building apps using the CLI and high-level APIs — even if you’re new to Rust. As your needs grow, you can adopt more Rust features at your own pace.
