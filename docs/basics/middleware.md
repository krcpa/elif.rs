Add cross-cutting behavior using the Middleware V2 system. Apply middleware per-route, per-group, or globally. Learn ordering, short-circuiting, and error propagation.

Includes:
- Applying middleware with attributes
- Global vs group vs route-level
- Request/response mutation
- Common patterns: auth, logging, rate-limits
